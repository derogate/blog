Hello! I am a Frontend Developer based in Brunei.

This is a personal blog where I _try_ to find the right words to express and articulate my thoughts precisely, and finally write it down in a coherent and cohesive manner, instead of letting it be unprocessed, unexamined and forgotten.

The goals are to document my journey, learn from my mistakes and keep track of my progress. From time to time, I also want to write about some random stuff that I find entertaining, amusing and interesting :icon{name="line-md:emoji-smile" size="1.25rem" class="mb-1"}
