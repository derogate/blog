## Context

I've been wanting to create my own little blog but was debating on which one to create from. I tried [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) locally but it feels outdated and clunky to work with. It does not seem to be as maintained compared to the arguably better alternative [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) which I haven't tried yet and looks more performant with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) under the hood but it is still in alpha and seems to have limited customizability. Tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but it have so much overhead configuration with Ruby language that I have no familiarity with and no interest in learning (yet). 

Given that I've been working on mainly Vue and was impressed by my experience working with Nuxt 3 in my day job, I finally settled with Nuxt Content v2 on top of the newly added [document-driven mode feature](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/document-driven). 

I chose [Atinux/content-wind](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind)'s theme and installed it straight away because I liked the theme and it provided what I wanted, which are:
::list{type="success"}
- dark mode (with light mode toggle)
- Tailwind 
- simple
- minimal
::

However, I did not understand how Nuxt content's configuration and everything else fits in the big picture. It was my first time setting up Nuxt on my own. Instead of installing the theme, I wanted to build it out from scratch so I can understand what I need and what I don't need by going through my thought process. 

My attempt involved using [Atinux/content-wind](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind) as reference while other parts, I am using the theme exactly as it is since some parts fits exactly what I wanted. Other reference includes [this Nuxt blog example](https://github.com/jvp-design/nuxt-blog-example).

### Initializing Nuxt Content project 
Initialize a Nuxt Content `blog` folder with the following command.

::code-group
  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm dlx nuxi init blog -t doc-driven 
  ```
  ```bash [npm]
  npx nuxi init blog -t doc-driven
  ```
::

```bash [pnpm]
  cd blog && pnpm i
  pnpm run dev
```

### Installations
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install -D @nuxt-themes/typography @nuxtjs/tailwindcss @nuxtjs/color-mode @vueuse/nuxt @vueuse/core nuxt-icon
```

The reasons for installing and using the packages:
- `@nuxt-themes/typography` for customizability of Nuxt Content prose components. Also, sets back the prose components to its intended styling due to Tailwind resetting default styles
- `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` for ease of styling with Tailwind
- `@nuxtjs/color-mode` for dark/light mode toggle
- `@vueuse/nuxt @vueuse/core` for VueUse utility functions. Required by some of the Nuxt Content prose components. The `@vueuse/nuxt` Nuxt module is useful in auto-importing VueUse functions
- `nuxt-icon` for ready to use icons

## Configurations

### nuxt.config.ts 
```typescript [nuxt.config.ts]
// https://v3.nuxtjs.org/api/configuration/nuxt.config
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    '@nuxt-themes/elements',
    '@nuxt-themes/typography',
  ],
  modules: [
    '@nuxtjs/tailwindcss',
    '@nuxt/content',
    '@nuxtjs/color-mode',
    '@vueuse/nuxt',
    'nuxt-icon'
  ],
  css: [
    '@/assets/styles/index.css'
  ],
  app: {
    baseURL: '/blog/'
  },
  ssr: true,
  colorMode: {
    preference: 'dark',
    fallback: 'dark',
    classSuffix: ''
  },
  content: {
    documentDriven: true,
    highlight: {
      theme: {
        dark: 'github-dark',
        default: 'github-light'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

The packages installed are added into `extends` and `modules` of nuxt.config.ts accordingly in order to use them. css is just styles to be imported and made available globally. The app baseURL is set to the repository name due to the domain that will be used for deployment choice (see [Deployment](#deployment)). ssr is explicitly set to true to prevent [404 Content Not Found error when using queryContent](https://github.com/nuxt/content/issues/1798). Dark mode is preferred and also served as fallback but still give user option to toggle to light mode. Take advantage of [document-driven mode feature](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/document-driven). Uses my preferred choice of syntax highlighting theme based on the color mode.

Since I am using Tailwind, I also have to add `classSuffix: ''` to remove the default `-mode` suffix so that the default `.dark` and `.light` CSS class that are added and toggled to the `:root` by [pinceau](https://pinceau.dev/configuration/media-queries) (from [@nuxtjs/color-mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/)) will work as intended.

### tailwind.config.ts 

```typescript [tailwind.config.ts]
import colors from 'tailwindcss/colors'

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: colors.gray
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I'll have to use `darkMode: 'class'` in order for the dark mode from [Tailwind with @nuxtjs/color-mode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/#tailwindcss) to work.

The theme is extended with primary  because the primary class will be exposed via [Tailwind `@apply` PostCSS directive](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) to allow it to be used for the `body` tag within [Vue SFC style](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-spec.html) for one of the layout .vue file.

### tokens.config.ts 

```typescript [tokens.config.ts]
import { defineTheme } from 'pinceau'
import colors from 'tailwindcss/colors'

// See Typography config on https://github.com/nuxt-themes/typography/blob/main/tokens.config.ts
export default defineTheme({
  color: {
    primary: colors.teal
  },
  typography: {
    color: {
      secondary: colors.gray
    }
  },
  prose: {
    code: {
      block: {
        backgroundColor: {
          initial: colors.gray['50'],
          dark: colors.black
        }
      },
      inline: {
        backgroundColor: {
          initial: colors.gray['100'],
          dark: colors.black
        }
      }
    },
    hr: {
      color: {
        initial: colors.gray['300'],
        dark: colors.gray['50']
      }
    }
  }
})
```

tokens.config.ts file handles [modification of appearance for typography and Nuxt Content prose components](https://typography.nuxt.space/#configuration).

### app.config.ts

```typescript [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  prose: {
    h1: { icon: 'material-symbols:link-rounded' },
    h2: { icon: 'material-symbols:link-rounded' },
    h3: { icon: 'material-symbols:link-rounded' },
    h4: { icon: 'material-symbols:link-rounded' },
    h5: { icon: 'material-symbols:link-rounded' },
  }
})
```

app.config.ts file is [a client exposed reactive configuration that can be updated at runtime](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/app-config#app-config-file). Anything saved here is retrievable via `useAppConfig()`. [Prose components icon can be changed here](https://typography.nuxt.space/#icons).

## Layout

The layout is nearly identical to [Atinux/content-wind](https://content-wind.nuxt.space/) but with a couple of differences - scroll to top button (just a simple button to scroll to top, which I will skip talking about it), navbar and blog post list. 

### Navbar.vue

```vue [Navbar.vue]
<template>
  <div ref="navbarRef" class="flex items-center justify-between p-4 h-[60px]">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-5">
      <NuxtLink 
        v-for="item in navigationLinks"
        :key="item._id"
        :to="item._path"
        class="border-b border-b-transparent hover:border-dashed hover:border-b-teal-500 hover:text-teal-500 transition duration-200 mt-2"
        :class="{ 'border-solid border-b-teal-500 text-teal-500 font-bold pointer-events-none': page?._path === item._path }">
        {{ item.title }}
      </NuxtLink>
    </div>

    <div class="flex items-center space-x-3 transition text-primary-500">
      <ColorModeSwitch />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const { data } = await useAsyncData('navbar-navigation', () => fetchContentNavigation());
const navigationLinks = computed(() => data.value?.filter(x => !x.children))

const { page } = useContent();

const navbarRef = ref<HTMLDivElement>();

const setCssVariables = useDebounceFn(() => {
  const navbarHeight = navbarRef.value?.getBoundingClientRect().height ||
                       navbarRef.value?.clientHeight || 
                       navbarRef.value?.offsetHeight || 
                       navbarRef.value?.scrollHeight || 0;
  document.body.style.setProperty('--navbar-height', navbarHeight + 'px');
}, 150)

useEventListener('resize', setCssVariables)

onMounted(() => {
  setCssVariables()
})
</script>
```

In the [original theme's navbar component](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind/blob/main/components/AppNavbar.vue), the navigation links loop through **ALL** links by default regardless if it's a child or nested route.

In my navbar.vue, I followed the same code but used [`fetchContentNavigation()`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/composables/fetch-content-navigation/) in order to loop through the top navigation links only, excluding any children routes. This way, I make the navbar simpler, minimal and cleaner as there is no cluttering of children routes that are not meant to be rendered in the navbar.

I can just install the theme and overwrite the theme's navbar.vue by creating my own navbar.vue and it'll still worked fine but I thought to myself might as well build from the ground up and just change stuff that needs to be changed along the way to cater to my requirements. In addition, I also added some CSS transition with Tailwind and set the navbar height as CSS variables so it can be used in other places such as to vertically center the main content equally in viewport while taking the navbar height into account.

### BlogPostListing.vue

```vue [BlogPostListing.vue]
<template>
  <ClientOnly>
    <DefaultLink
      v-for="post in posts" 
      :key="post._id"
      :to="post._path"
      class="w-fit group">
      <span :title="`Published on: ${post.publishedOn ?? '-'}. Last updated on: ${post.lastUpdated ?? '-'}`" class="text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 group-hover:text-inherit leading-[1] mr-2">
        {{ post.lastUpdated ?? post.publishedOn }}
      </span>
      <span>
        {{ post.title }}
      </span>
    </DefaultLink>
  </ClientOnly>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const posts = await queryContent("posts")
  .where({
    _empty: false,
    _draft: false,
  })
  .find();
</script>
```

This a component to loop through the content under `/posts` & render it as links for user to click on. Currently, it is just meant to be a long list of links of posts. Once the number of links gets very big or there is really a need to organize and query, then I'll add search, filter and pagination in the future. For the time being, manually Ctrl+F to search by name of the blog post title is sufficient enough :icon{name="line-md:emoji-smile" size="1.25rem" class="mb-1"}

## Deployment

For this blog, I am trying out deploying it to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with continuous integration/continuous delivery via [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). As I am going to use the default Github pages domain followed by the repository name, this requires [defineNuxtConfig app.baseURL to be set to the repository name](#nuxtconfigts) in order for Nuxt routing to work properly.  References include [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-vue-and-nuxt), [Setup and continuously deploy your documentation on Github in under five minutes (Nuxt Content + Github Pages/Actions) | by Kevin Grüneberg | Medium](https://kevcodez.medium.com/setup-and-continuously-deploy-your-documentation-on-github-in-under-five-minutes-nuxt-content-cbaceb350c4c), [https://github.com/lucpotage/nuxt-github-pages](https://github.com/lucpotage/nuxt-github-pages) and [How to deploy a Nuxt 3 app in Github Pages - Alejandro Suárez](https://alejandrosuarez.eu/blog/how-to-deploy-nuxt3-app-in-github-pages/). The following `gh-pages.yml` is the Github Actions workflow to generate & push distribution files to `gh-pages` branch.

```yaml [gh-pages.yml]
name: Update distribution files for Github Pages
run-name: Generate & push distribution files to gh-pages branch

on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    env:
      working-directory: blog
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        node: [18.15.0]
        pnpm: [6.1]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    permissions: 
      contents: write
    concurrency:
      group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: ${{ matrix.pnpm }}

      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with: 
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      
      - name: Install all dependencies with pnpm
        run: pnpm install
        working-directory: ${{env.working-directory}}
      
      - name: Invoke Nuxt Static Site Generation
        run: pnpm run generate
        working-directory: ${{env.working-directory}}
      
      - name: Push to gh-pages branch
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # automatically invoked
          publish_dir: ./${{env.working-directory}}/dist # copy contents from this folder to gh-pages branch
```

Once the statically generated files are pushed to `gh-pages` branch, building & deploying step is required. In current Github repository > Settings tab > Pages tab > Build and Deployment section, the `gh-pages` branch is to be selected. Afterwards, every time there is a change `gh-pages` branch especially after the Github Actions workflow finishes, the build and deployment process will start automatically and updates the live website once the deployment finishes without error.

As for my typical workflow, I work within a separate `dev` branch or other derived branch from it to avoid unnecessary, unintentional re-building and re-deployment especially with small, frequent commits. When I am confident I want to deploy my changes, I simply pull my changes from `dev` branch to `master` branch and the Github Actions workflow will handle for me the build and deployment process to the live website.
