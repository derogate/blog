# The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane - Book Summary

- lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentence
- reduce how quickly and how often you nod
- pause for two full seconds before you speak

- Charismatic behavior have 3 core elements
  1. presence
  2. power
  3. warmth

- Presence is paying attention to what's going on rather than being caught up in your thoughts

- Power is being able to affect the world around us. Can also be seen in
  - appearance
  - other's reaction to this person
  - body language

- Warmth is: well-meaning, kindly, altruistic, caring or willing to impact the world in a positive way. Can be seen almost entirely through body language and behaviour

- Through human  interaction, we look for clues to evaluate warmth or power. We tend to accept whatever you project.
  - expensive clothing: assumption is wealth
  - friendly body language: assumption is good intentions
  - confident posture: assumption is the person has something to be confident about

- Power and warmth are necessary conditions for charisma
  - Powerful but no warmth: impressive but not charismatic, can come across as arrogant, cold or standoffish
  - Has warmth but no power: likable but not charismatic, can come across as overeager, subservient or desperate to please

- When interacting with someone, assume the him/her will feel what you do relates to him/her.

- To counter charisma-impairing physical discomfort
  - Prevent
  - Recognize
  - remedy or explain

- Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again

- 3 step process to handle difficult experience:
  1. Destigmatize discomfort
  2. Neutralize negativity
  3. Rewrite reality

- Destigmatize discomfort is to remind yourself that internal discomfort is normal part of human experience

- Shame is fear of being unlovable - a belief that we are flawed and unworthy of love and belonging

- How to destigmatize discomfort:
  - Remember that uncomfortable emotions are normal and natural
  - Think of others who have gone through this before, especially people you admire
  - See it as one burden share by many
  - Think of it as you being a part of community of human experiencing this one feeling at this very moment

- The next step is neutralize negativity: realize that your thoughts are not necessarily valid and not necessarily accurate at all as it can give filtered, incomplete, distorted and biased representation of reality

- We want to avoid falling into the trap of trying to argue with unhelpful thoughts or suppressing them.

- How to neutralize negativity:
  - don't assume your thoughts are accurate. Just because your mind comes up with something doesn't necessarily means it has any validity. Assume you're missing a lot of elements, which could be positive.

  - See your thoughts as graffiti on a wall or merely electrical impulses flickering in your brain

  - Label your negative experience: self-criticism, anger, anxiety

  - Depersonalize the experience. Instead of "I'm feeling ashamed", try "There is shame being felt." Imagine you're a scientist observing a phenomenon: "How interesting, there are self-critical thoughts arising."

  - Imagine seeing yourself from afar until you see the planet Earth. Then zoom in on continent, country, city, room, and your little self. One little being having a particular experience at this particular moment.

  - Consider the worst-case outcome for your situation. Realize that whatever it is, you'll survive.

  - Think of all the previous times when you felt just like this - that you wouldn't make it through - and yet clearly you did

- Finally, rewrite reality. Deciding to change your belief about what happened (technically, Cognitive Reappraisal), is far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.

- Think "In what way can this turn out to be absolutely perfect for me?"

- Decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself. Be conveniently deluded.

- Rewriting reality/reframing reality:
  - Which mental state would be most useful in this situation?

  - Which imagined alternate reality would help me get there?
